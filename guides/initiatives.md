## Initiatives

### Setting up an Initiative

An initiative proposal should be **brief** and provide and overview and argument and use the [template](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/blob/master/_posts/initiatives/-initiative-xxx.md). You can add more sections as appropriate, including sample code, project roadmap, etc. Examples can be found in our [initives archive](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/tree/master/initiatives-internal) ðŸ”’.

Once a proposal has been drafted and approved, the squad will set up a new initiative with support from the [Operations squad](../initiatives.md#operations)

### Leads, Opportunities & Client Proposals

While the [Opportunities squad](../initiatives.md#opportunities) is mainly in charge of sales lead generation,
all members may pursue leads as they come up.
Members are strongly encouraged to record leads into the co-operative's [leads tracking system](https://link.hypha.coop/leads) whether or not we want to pursue this lead.

If a member decides to pursue a **lead**,
they can reach out to gauge potential interest in working together.
If the lead expresses intention to proceed with a concrete project in mind,
this becomes an **opportunity**.
The member now heads up this sales effort and drafts an **Initiative Proposal** with support from the [Opportunities squad](../initiatives.md#opportunities), then present it (e.g., at a meeting, or via virtual channels) to see whether the co-operative wants to move forward.
In this meeting, we should discuss any concerns by other members,
and gauge team capacity given project timelines.
