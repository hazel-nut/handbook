# Time Tracking at Hypha

Hypha operates as a consultancy, so billing accurately for our time spent on projects is paramount. In 2023, we are moving from an hourly tracking system to a committed capacity process. Each employee, contractor and member-worker’s time will be accounted for in half-day increments, and project leads will forecast the allotted hours for team members. Each person will also be allocated at least one half-day to commit to internal, co-operative related work.

Project leads will invoice clients at the full capacity committed to their project for each person on their team, and will review time commitments on a quarterly basis. 

Hypha team members will continue to be responsible for managing their own time accordingly, and for ensuring they are meeting the commitments set out by the project lead.

## How this works in practice

If Alice works 4 days a week at Hypha and works on two client initiatives, her commitment will look something like this:

| Initiative | Commitment |
|:--|:--|
| Client initiative A | 2 day |
| Client initiative B | 1.5 day |
| Hypha (non-billable) | 0.5 day |

Based on this, Alice's time is 87.5% billable. When we invoice the clients, Hypha bills Alice's day rate, for example at $1,600 x 2 for Client A and $1,600 x 1.5 for Client B = $5,600 per week.

## Financial forecasting

For the Finance Working Group’s projections, we know that Hypha:

- has 12 days of [public holiday](https://handbook.hypha.coop/holidays.html) equivalent to **three 4-day weeks**
- has Christmas week closure (Dec 27-Jan 1) roughly equal to **one 4-day week**
- has **three weeks of vacation** for the employee

Therefore, Alice works 45 of the 52 calendar weeks in a year. 45 x $5,600 = $252,000 is effectively the revenue that Alice brings in over the calendar year.
