# Compensation and Benefits

In December 2021 we revised our total compensation and switched to a salaried model. At that time we polled member-workers on what types of [benefits they want](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_jQ8b15P5KrqxPI9KEVWIgLOlG5HDE5xBazd5Ncfd8U/edit) ðŸ”’ and a decision was made to implement health benefits as many were identified as a priority, detailed below.

## Compensation

[Think we should add something public here than link to the private section, though personally fine with all of it being public except individual allocations]

## Health Benefits

Our provider is the Co-operators and we are able to provide the following to members based on hours worked:

| Employee Status           | Benefits                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| PT (0.25 or 1 day/week )  | No benefits                          | 
| PT (0.50 or 2 days/week)  | Life, AD&D, LTD + HSA                |
| FT (above 0.50)           | Life, AD&D, LTD, EHC, Dental + HSA   |

What do all of those mean?

### Life (Basic Life and Dependant Life) 

### AD&D 

### Long Term Disability (LTD)

### Extended Healthcare (EHC)

### Dental
