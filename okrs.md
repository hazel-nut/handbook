# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

Hypha uses Objectives and Key Results for planning and setting collective goals.
We currently define OKRs at the working group level and update them quarterly in our [**OKR tracking sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMFS3IhzZOFQA-yjt7lFcoVO0Ry6erFEH7D1NswvDtA/edit). 

## About OKRs

**OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.** The Objectives tend to be the desired outcomes that you want, and the Key Results are the measurable ways you know you’re on track to reach them.

An **Objective** helps answer the question, _“Where do I want to go?”_
A **Key Result** helps answer, _“How will I know I’m getting there?”_
