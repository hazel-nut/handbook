# Holidays, Time Off, and Leaves


## Sick Days, Personal Time Off, and Leaves of Absence
### Sick Days
We have no policy limiting the number of sick days that members take. 

### Personal Time Off (Vacation)
On a quarterly basis, members should identify what a full work week means for them in terms of days (i.e., a three-, four-, or five-day work week). Based on this, members are entitled to 3 weeks of vacation, and only a maximum of 2 weeks (about 4%) can be paid out.

| Days in work week | Vacation days over year |
|:--|:--|
| 3 | 9 |
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Lieu days
When an employee works beyond the allotted hours in their full work week, they are expected to take a lieu day at a later date so as not to overwork themself. For example, if Alice commits to working a four-day work week but ends up working five days in a particular week, they should work three days the next week (or within a reasonable amount of time).

### Leaves of Absence
Prolonged absences beyond the allocated vacation days are not limited, but they are not considered paid vacation.

### Tracking
Member-workers are responsible for tracking their vacation day usage and reporting to the Finance working group at end-of-year for the purpose of paying out unused days. Only a maximum of 2 weeks (about 4%) can be paid out, the rest you are forced to take.

Coming soon: Our office pet, Roo, will help us track our days in Matrix.


## Public and Additional Holidays
Our virtual office is closed during [Ontario's nine public holidays](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/public-holidays) and member-workers are entitled (encouraged) to those days off and receive an [annualized public holiday pay](https://handbook.hypha.coop/finance.html#public-holiday-pay). We recognize three additional holidays where the office is closed and members are encouraged not to work: Civic Holiday (first Monday in August), May Day or International Workers' Day (May 1), and Remembrance Day (November 11). During December Holidays the virtual office is closed between Dec 25 and Jan 1.

In cases where members choose to work on these days, or under special circumstances where a project requires, they will receive [regular wages](https://handbook.hypha.coop/finance.html#public-holiday-pay) for those hours and are entitled to take substitute time off.
