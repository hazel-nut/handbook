# Reporting HST

Hypha reports HST to the Government of Canada quarterly. Deadlines for submitting HST to the CRA is at the end of the following month after the end of each quarter is completed. This means end of April, July, October and January. The process has three parts. Preparing the HST (this is done by the bookkeeper), filing the HST with CRA and if required payment of the amount owed.

## Preparing HST

The bookkeeper will prepare the HST reporting shortly after each quarter is over. They will send an e-mail to the Finance WG that looks like this:

```
Please file and pay the HST as per following lines:

Line 101 : 10,000.00
Line 105: 2,000.00
Line 108: 1,000.00

109-NET TAX 1000-will be automatically calculated
115- Amount Owing 1000- will be automatically calculated
```

This will trigger Finance to take action.
