# Requesting and Filling a Letter of Employment

### Requesting a letter
1. Email `operations@hypha.coop` and request a letter of employment.
2. Operations will email you back with a link to a signed letter for you to use.

A letter of employment will typically contain your full name, title, start date at Hypha, and current salary. If other details are needed, please let us know in the email.

### Filling a request
There are two roles involved:
1. The administrator: person who sets up the document and requests a signature.
2. The signer: person who fills out the details and signs.

These roles may be filled by the same person. However - if an employee who is a member of the Operations WG needs a letter of employment, that employee should not also be the signer. It looks sketchy even though it's not. ðŸ¥¸

**Administrator:**
1. In Dropbox Sign, navigate to 'Templates > Saved' in the left-hand menu.
2. Select 'Use Template' beside the 'Letter of employment' template.
3. Follow the usual process for sending a Dropbox Sign document.
   * Only one signer is necessary: a member of the Operations Working Group.
   * Fill out the chosen signer's name (this could be you) and use the `operations@hypha.coop` email.
   * In the 'Message' field of the email, fill out the relevant details of the employee (full name, title, start date, current salary).

**Signer:**
1. Confirm these details using the _Employees_ and the _Operations Planning_ spreadsheets.
2. Fill out the letter template with the current date and employee details.
3. Sign.
4. Save the letter in Drive (Operations > Employment Letters) and email the employee a link to the PDF.
