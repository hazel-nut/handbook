# Salary Review Process

**Objective:** Each member or employee completes a self-assessment and team review of their Level and Responsibility (defined [here](/How-we-work/salary.md)) and identifies their new salary according the Hypha's salary matrix,

**Timing:** Annual salary L/R reviews occur in the first quarter of the year. Org-wide peer feedback should be completed before the salary review takes place.

**Salary adjustments:** To avoid the operational overhead of adjusting salaries multiple times per year, our annual cost-of-living increases (if approved at AGM) will be applied to the full matrix at the same time as the next annual salary review. Members and employees undertaking a 6 month re-review to hit particular L/R goals may have their salary adjusted twice in a single year if necessary. 

**Terminology**
* **Consensus:** everyone involved agrees on the decision being made. Consensus is a high bar.
* **Consent:** no one involved objects to the decision being made (i.e., if no one blocks the decision, everyone has consented to it).
* **Consistency reviewer** (per team): someone with insight into the full team's function and working habits who is able to judge consistency of L/R across the group they're reviewing. Chosen by the team at the start of the process.
* **Budget reviewer:** a person or group of people with an org-wide understanding of Hypha's finances who can judge the financial impact of the salary changes and whether Hypha can afford it.

# How it works

## Part 1: Self-Assessment
First, you perform a self-assessment and identifies your L, R, and resultant salary that these factors produce
 * Time commitment should be decided in advance with your team/practice lead. This factor is not actually under review by the group, but is necessary to calculate the salary number.

To make this decision, use the following self-assessment questions to help you decide whether the current L and R make sense:

1. What are your strengths?
2. What are you most proud of accomplishing at work in the past year?
3. What are your opportunities for improvement?
4. What could you have done better at work over the past year?
5. How do you think you have contributed the most to the co-op over the past year?
6. Think about the things you do well, and the things you like doing at Hypha. How can you build on your strengths to level up your career in the coming year? 

Use [this resource for tips ](https://nanoglobals.com/self-assessment-performance-review-evaluation/)on how to craft your self-assessment, but remember that this document is for you, so use whatever format will be most valuable in your conversation with your review group.

Also consider the feedback you received during their peer review process.

## Part 2: Peer review
Invite **2 people** who you feel are qualified to assess and review your L/R based on their knowledge of you and your work. This forms a 3-person group that reaches consensus about your L and R.
 * "Qualified" is subjective -- you are best-positioned to judge who knows the quality of your work, and Hypha as a whole trusts you to choose fairly.
 * People may decline an invitation if they do not feel qualified. You must then invite someone else.

Schedule a meeting with your review group (we recommend 30 min if you are staying consistent at the same L/R, and 60 min if you intend to change on either axis).

What to expect during the review:
* Clearly present your self-assessment and why you feel it is justified.
* Be prepared to justify changes from your current L/R and answer questions that your review group has.
* Be open to feedback and differing perspectives about your work -- remember that we are peers and trying to support one another and remain equitable within the co-op.
* By the end of your meeting, all people in the review group (including you) should **reach consensus** on your L and R.
* After the review meeting, you will send an email with your new L/R and time commitment to the Operations working group, who will meet with Finance to approve and finalize any salary changes.

## Part 3: Team consistency review
For each team or practice area, a **consistency reviewer** will be chosen to review and **consent** to the array of L/R across their team. The consistency reviewers can solicit feedback, host discussion, and request re-reviews.
 * A 'team' or 'practice area' is a group that works closely together on the same material. It makes sense to understand the entire group's set of L/R and compare them to one another.
 * A person in multiple teams or practice areas will be reviewed as part of each group, and all consistency reviewers need to consent.

## Part 4: Budget review
One **budget reviewer** for all of Hypha reviews and **consents** to the array of salaries across the organization. The budget reviewer can solicit feedback, host discussion, and request re-reviews.

## Part 5: Implementation
The Operations working group enters the new L/R into the Operations Planning sheet and makes adjustments to the Financial Planning sheet for the next payroll period.

In the next payroll period following the review process, Finance working group will pay out salaries according to the new L/R.

* Review peer feedback. Even if you received feedback that you did not agree with, use this as an opportunity to look at the feedback objectively
* Consider Hypha: review the relevant parts of the handbook and website to refresh your understanding of what it is we do, and how your work support and aligns with this
* Review the Operations Planning sheet to see other people's L/R and compare the kind of work you do
