# Initiatives

## Setting up an Initiative

An initiative proposal should be **brief** and provide and overview and argument and use the [template](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/blob/master/_posts/initiatives/-initiative-xxx.md). You can add more sections as appropriate, including sample code, project roadmap, etc. Examples can be found in our [initiatives archive](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/tree/master/initiatives-internal) ðŸ”’ and public [initiatives archive](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/tree/main/_posts/initiatives) ðŸ”“.

Once a proposal has been drafted and approved, the squad will set up a new initiative with support from the [Operations squad](initiatives.md#operations)

## Leads, Opportunities & Client Proposals

While the [Opportunities squad](initiatives.md#opportunities) is mainly in charge of sales lead generation,
all members may pursue leads as they come up.
Members are strongly encouraged to record leads into the co-operative's [leads tracking system](https://link.hypha.coop/leads) whether or not we want to pursue this lead.

If a member decides to pursue a **lead**,
they can reach out to gauge potential interest in working together.
If the lead expresses intention to proceed with a concrete project in mind,
this becomes an **opportunity**.
The member now heads up this sales effort and drafts an **Initiative Proposal** with support from the [Opportunities squad](initiatives.md#opportunities), then present it (e.g., at a meeting, or via virtual channels) to see whether the co-operative wants to move forward.
In this meeting, we should discuss any concerns by other members,
and gauge team capacity given project timelines.

An initiative proposal should be **brief** and provide and overview and argument and use the template for [setting up an initiative](#setting-up-an-initiative).

### Drafting and Submission

Proposals to be submitted to a potential client or grant committee should be drafted by members who will participate in the project with support from the [Opportunities squad](initiatives.md#opportunities). The squad has expertise in drafting client and grant project proposals, and managing the proposal process, so it is helpful to involve members of that group from the drafting stage. All  involved in the proposal drafting make up the **initiative squad** that will sign off on the final draft to be submitted.

If a proposal is accepted, this squad will lead the initial consultation meetings with the client (e.g. discuss terms of payment and project logistics), draft and sign a **Client Agreement** (see [template](https://link.hypha.coop/client-agreement)). If a proposal fails, we encourage reaching out to the client or grant committee for feedback and holding an internal retrospective.

Regardless whether the proposal is successful,
the squad should add a copy to the _correct_ place: [initiatives private archive](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/tree/master/initiatives-internal) ðŸ”’ or [public archive](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/tree/main/_posts/initiatives) ðŸ”“ for future reference.

### Launching an Initiative 

Once an initative has been approved, the lead should complete the following tasks:

- Add a copy of the initiative proposal to the _correct_ initiatives archive: [private](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing-private/tree/master/initiatives-internal) ðŸ”’ or [public](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/tree/main/_posts/initiatives) ðŸ”“
- Ensure the initiative tracking sheet is correct, has the lead and involved people listed and an estimate of hours (should be all there from quarterly meeting)
- Create a clockify project for time-tracking convos around it

### Wrapping up an Initiative

Once an initiative has concluded, is it the responsibility of the lead to ensure the following tasks are completed:
- Close out tasks on task boards; remove meetings from the shared calendar; remove from list of active initiatives in the handbook and tracking sheet
- Prepare a brief update for the next quarterly planning session to discuss whether the goal was accomplished and the work was done
- Delieve that share-back at the appropropriate all hands / planning session
