# Salary Review Process

**Objective:** Each member or employee completes a self-assessment and has their salary set based on the Hypha salary grid

**Timing:** Annual salary reviews will follow the peer-review process and should occur in the first quarter of the year. Peer reviews must be completed before the salary review takes place, but the two processes should take place consecutively.

**Salary adjustments:** To avoid the operational overhead of adjusting salaries multiple times per year, our annual cost-of-living increases (if approved at AGM) will be applied to the full matrix at the same time as the next annual salary review. Members and employees undertaking a 6 month re-review to hit particular L/R goals may have their salary adjusted twice in a single year if necessary. 


# How it works

## Part 1: Self-Assessment

Assess where you are currently on the salary grid and consider whether you want to:
* Move up
* Move down
* Stay where you are

To make this decision, use the following self-assessment questions to help you decide whether the current L and R make sense:

1. What are your strengths?
2. What are you most proud of accomplishing at work in the past year?
3. What are your opportunities for improvement?
4. What could you have done better at work over the past year?
5. How do you think you have contributed the most to the co-op over the past year?
6. Think about the things you do well, and the things you like doing at Hypha. How can you build on your strengths to level up your career in the coming year? 

Use [this resource for tips ](https://nanoglobals.com/self-assessment-performance-review-evaluation/)on how to craft your self-assessment, but remember that this document is for you, so use whatever format will be most valuable in your conversation with your review group.

Also consider the feedback you received during their peer review process.

Lastly, before you meet with your review group, make any prep material available to the members of your review group.


## Part 2: Review Group

Once the self-assessment is complete, you will schedule a meeting with your review group, which will consist of two or more people from Hypha. The review group will consist of one person you work closely with on a project, and someone with whom you share less direct project work. Review groups will be assigned and communicated by the Operations working group.

What to expect during the review:
* At the outset of this hour-long meeting, clearly state your intent to either **change or retain** your current position on the salary grid.
* In cases where you are advocating for a **salary increase**, the review group will come to consensus about your L/R and time commitment within the review meeting.
  * There is no appeal process following this decision; however, you may request an additional review process 6 months from the date of the original decision
* In cases where you would like to work fewer days or hold less responsibility, resulting in a **salary decrease**, the review group can only approve the reduction if the project lead thinks the project will be manageable with the change in commitment. A transition plan may be required.
* After the review meeting, you will send an email with your new L/R and time commitment to the Operations working group, who will meet with Finance to approve and finalize any salary changes.
