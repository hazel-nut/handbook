# **Parental leave policy**

*This policy applies to employees who are new parents regardless of how a child has joined the employee’s family. A separate ‘pregnancy leave policy’ may be developed at a later date to support employees who are pregnant and giving birth.*

## **Federal and provincial resources**

* [Federal EI maternity and parental benefits](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental.html)
* [Ontario pregnancy and parental leave](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/pregnancy-and-parental-leave)

## **Eligibility for parental leave**

New parents are entitled to up to 69 weeks of **unpaid** parental leave. Information about dividing parental leave between two parents is available in the linked resources above.

Hypha employees are eligible for paid parental leave for **3 out of the next 12 months** after a child arrives in the employee’s family. These months do not have to be consecutive, but Hypha’s salary top-up program is designed with EI payments in mind and EI payments generally must be consecutive.

## **EI payments**

Assuming a standard parental leave, federal EI benefits pay 55% of an employee’s salary, up to a weekly maximum of $668 (**monthly maximum of $2700**). For the purposes of calculating EI payments, the annual salary where the weekly maximum is reached is **$58,909.09.** Nearly all of our salary matrix entries are above this value.

There is a possibility that EI will pay for [non-consecutive weeks of parental leave](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental/special-circumstances.html), but a new claim must be submitted. 

### **Hypha’s top-off program**

Hypha will pay three months’ salary, less the EI payment, up to a maximum salary of 3x our base minimum salary. This top-up-cap salary is saved in the Operations Planning spreadsheet on the Salary Matrix tab. 

Here are some examples of what a pay cycle might look like for employees at various levels:

**Employee A (L0 R0 S0) works 4 days per week and has an annual salary of $52,531** 

* This employee’s monthly salary is **$4,377.58**
* EI will pay 55% of the monthly salary: 0.55(4377.58) \=  $2,407.67 paid by EI
* Hypha will pay the balance: 4377.58 \- 2407.67 \= $1,969.91 paid by Hypha

**Employee B (L6 R4 S3) works 5 days per week and has an annual salary of $260,249.** 

* This is above Hypha’s top-up-cap, so we will use an annual salary of **$157,593.**
* This employee’s monthly salary is **$13,132.75**
* EI will pay 55% of the monthly salary to a max of $2700:  $2,700 paid by EI
* Hypha will pay the balance: 13132.75 \- 2700 \= $10,432.75 paid by Hypha

## **Q\&A**

1. **Does taking parental leave count as a month with a 0-day work week for the purposes of calculating average vacation?**
   * Employees are entitled to 3 weeks’ worth of paid vacation based on their average work week throughout the year.
   * No, an employee on parental leave is still a full-time employee at their usual time commitment, so their vacation allotment is not impacted by parental leave.
2. **Does an employee continue accruing labour patronage while on parental leave?**
   * No. Labour patronage is calculated by “hours worked” as a member, and while a member is still employed full-time during parental leave, they are not working hours. This also means that a probationary member's probationary period would pause on the "hours worked" side but not on the "time passed" side.
   * A person must complete \>800 hours of paid work for the co-op in the last 52 weeks AND have been an employee for at least 1 year to be eligible for full membership. Historically, the limiting factor on this is "time passed" because it's very easy to work 800 hours for the co-op; it usually takes 25 weeks to hit that number.
3. **Does seniority pause while an employee is on parental leave?**
   * No, employee seniority does not pause. Hypha doesn’t use employee seniority for anything but we do track *membership* seniority, which also will not pause. This is consistent with a probationary period not pausing on the "time passed" side.
4. **Can an employee break up months of parental leave (i.e., take 1 month of leave, work for 1 month, take 2 months of leave)?**
   * Technically yes, but it may not be practical or efficient for the employee. EI payments may not allow for returning to work between leaves, and Hypha’s top-up program will not compensate for a lack of EI payments.
   * In the example for Employee B above, Hypha will pay **$10,432.75** for each month of parental leave regardless of whether the employee is being paid by EI or not.
