# Holidays, Time Off, and Leaves

## Vacation and PTO Days

On a quarterly basis, members should identify their [time commitment](time-commitment.md) (i.e., three- or four-day work week). Based on this, members are entitled to 3 weeks of flexible time off, plus the December Holidays between Christmas Day and New Year's Day, when Hypha's virtual office is closed.

| Days in work week | Flexible vacation days over year |
|------------------:|---------------------------------:|
|                 1 |                                3 |
|                 2 |                                6 |
|                 3 |                                9 |
|                 4 |                               12 |
|                 5 |                               15 |

It is strongly recommended that members take all their alloted days, and in the event that they are not fully utilized, only a maximum of 2 weeks can be paid out each year.

## How to track vacation time

1. Send an email to [Operations](mailto:operations@hypha.coop). Include vacation start and end dates, and number of days you will be taking off. 
Also note: your usual day off should not be tracked as a vacation day (eg: You donâ€™t work Fridays in a regular work week)
2. Operations coordinator will update the [vacation tracking spreadsheet](https://link.hypha.coop/vacation)ðŸ”’
3. Operations coordinator will add your vacation to the [shared Availability calendar](https://link.hypha.coop/availability)ðŸ”’
4. Block out your personal Hypha calendar with out of office/vacation time to ensure people donâ€™t book meetings during the time you are away.
5. Please post a message in #private-general chat right before you go on vacation, as a reminder you will be away and when.


## Lieu Days

When a member works beyond the allotted hours in their full work week, they are expected to take a lieu day at a later date so as not to overwork themself. For example, if Alice commits to working a four-day work week but ends up working five days in a particular week, they should work three days the next week (or within a reasonable amount of time).

Lieu days are self-tracked and arranged with the member's initiative leads as to be not distruptive to the initiative.

## Sick Days

We have no policy limiting the number of sick days that members take.

## Leaves of Absence

Prolonged absences beyond the allocated vacation days are not limited, but they are not considered paid vacation, and arrangements should be made with initiative leads with corresponding [time commitment](time-commitment.md) adjustments.

## Public and Additional Holidays

Our virtual office is closed during [Ontario's nine public holidays](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/public-holidays). We recognize three additional holidays where the office is closed and members are encouraged not to work:

- Civic Holiday (first Monday in August)
- May Day or International Workers' Day (May 1)
- Remembrance Day (November 11)

Additionally, the December Holidays where the virtual office is closed between Dec 25 and Jan 1.

If a public holiday lands on a member's off-day under a four-day work week, the member should take one of the work days off as a make-up holiday.
