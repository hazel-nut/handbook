# Employee Salary Guide

This document outlines the salary tiers of Hypha employees and the evaluation process.

## Evaluation

Each employee will perform a self-assessment to determine their *L* and *R* and discuss their evaluation at a meeting with all full members of the organization. *S* is determined based on hours in Clockify.

Salaries are reassessed at minimum annually, or more frequently, at maximum quarterly. If a new hire or existing employee negotiates a higher salary, we should reassess all roles to ensure pay consistency.

In the next *Annual General Meeting*, members will discuss:

- geolocation factors (e.g., location-based salary)
- whether to modify the senority tiers (e.g., granularity, multipliers)
- responsibility tier for back office lead roles

### Skills and experiences

**L0**: Entry-level with proficiency in a few core skills for relevant position. Not self-sufficient and needs mentorship and peer learning to progress.

**L1**: Years using core skills for relevant position. Able to self-motivate and independently acquire new skills as required for the role. Needs mentorship for problem setting and strategy but self-sufficient in execution.

**L2**: Many years with core skills and broad set of adjacent skills for position. Self-motivated, self-managing, able to mentor others, and have done a full cycle (start, mid, end, fail) of relevant projects. Trusted to sign off on deliverables relevant to areas of expertise.

**L3**: Confident with core skills, adjacent skills, leads and mentors others. Brings their own distinct approach to a relevant position to articulate and execute. Widely regarded as domain expert internal and external to the organization.

**+1L**: A +1 modifier may be applied if necessary to fill a position requiring a skill with high market demand.

### Responsibilities

**R0**: Meets [good member requirements](https://handbook.hypha.coop/member-workers.html#being-a-good-member). Requires support in defining tasks.

**R1**: Takes ownership of key deliverables and occasional leadership of small initiatives or sub-initiatives within larger initiatives. Supports others in small ways (e.g., peering).

**R2**: Leads initiatives and/or back office functions regularly and reliably. Defines objectives and tasks, ensures the quality of deliverables, and manages internal and/or client and partner relationships. Often serves as point person to interface with internal and external teams.

**R3**: Leads one or more major initiatives regularly and reliably. Serves as point person to long-running client initiatives. Actively contributes to developing the organizational strategy and represents the organization publicly.

### Seniority in organization

**S0**: A new employee who is not yet accepted as a full member.

**S1**:	A full member who has spent less than a third of *M* hours in the organization based on total hours worked since August 1st of 2019.

**S2**:	A full member who has spent less than two thirds of *M* hours in the organization based on total hours worked since August 1st of 2019.

**S3**:	A full member who has spent more than two thirds of *M* hours in the organization based on total hours worked since August 1st of 2019.

**+1S**: A +1 modifier is applied to a *Founding Member* of the organization.

**M represents the maximum work hours for a single employee since the incorporation date of August 1, 2019. This is calculated as 400 hours multiplied by the number of quarters since July 1, 2019.*

## Base salaries

The *base salaries* are listed in CAD for 4-day work weeks, or 400 hours per quarter. This is also called *1.00 time*. Part-time employees will have a 0.75, 0.50, 0.25 multipler proportional to their days worked per week.

These rates are reassessed each year at our *Annual General Meeting*, taking into consideration inflation and other factors.
