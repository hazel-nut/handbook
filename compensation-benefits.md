# Compensation and Benefits

In December 2021 we revised our total compensation and switched to a salaried model. At that time we polled member-workers on what types of [benefits they want](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_jQ8b15P5KrqxPI9KEVWIgLOlG5HDE5xBazd5Ncfd8U/edit) ðŸ”’ and a decision was made to implement health benefits as many were identified as a priority, detailed below.

## Compensation

Employees at Hypha, full-time or part-time, permanent or otherwise, are evaluated based on the following criteria:

* skills and experiences
* responsibilities
* seniority in organization

Full details and salary tiers are detailed in our [Employee Salary Guide](salary.md).

## Health Benefits

Our provider is the Co-operators and we are able to provide the following to members based on hours worked:

| Employee Status           | Benefits                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| PT (0.25 or 1 day/week )  | No benefits                          | 
| PT (0.50 or 2 days/week)  | Life, AD&D, LTD + HSA                |
| FT (0.75 or 3 days/week, and above) | Life, AD&D, LTD, EHC, Dental + HSA   |

What do all of those mean? See their [definitions by the Co-operators](https://www.cooperators.ca/en/Group/group-benefits/product-services.aspx).
