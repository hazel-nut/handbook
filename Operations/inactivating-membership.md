# Inactivating Membership

When members seek to go inactive they should do the following:

1. Send an email to [operations@hypha.coop](mailto:operations@hypha.coop) with notification of the change and the date you wish to become inactive and return (if known).

Operations then will work with Infrastructure to update appropriate permissions and access inline with our Working Open guidelines and [offboarding checklist](./templates/checklist-offboarding.md).
