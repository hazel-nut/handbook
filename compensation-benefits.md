# Compensation and Benefits

## Cash Compensation

Employees at Hypha, full-time or part-time, permanent or otherwise, are evaluated based on the following criteria:

* skills and experiences
* responsibilities
* seniority in organization

Full details and salary tiers are detailed in our [Employee Salary Guide](salary.md).

## Health Benefits

Canadian employees are eligible for enrolment into our group benefits plan three months after their start date. Foreign contractors receive a modifier to their cash salary in place of group benefits.

Our provider is the Co-operators and we are able to provide the following to members based on hours worked:

| Employee Status                     | Benefits                             |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| PT (0.25 or 1 day/week )            | No benefits                          | 
| PT (0.50 or 2 days/week)            | Life, AD&D, LTD + HSA                |
| FT (0.75 or 3 days/week, and above) | Life, AD&D, LTD, EHC, Dental + HSA   |

What do all of those mean? See their [definitions by the Co-operators](https://www.cooperators.ca/en/Group/group-benefits/product-services.aspx).

## Labour Patronage

As a worker co-operative, Hypha has a policy of allocating part of our annual surplus (or loss) towards individual members' capital accounts, as defined in section 6.4 of our [bylaws](bylaws.md).

The co-operative keeps an account balance for each full member, and after each fiscal year, 20% of the co-operative's surplus/loss in that year is allocated among all the members according to labour contribution (i.e., [time commitment](time-commitment.md)) through the fiscal year.

At the moment, the account balance is loaned to the co-operative at 0% interest as liquidity for business activities, and there is no process for members to receive the balance, except when a member resigns their membership, then their account balance is paid out.

## Client Initiative Allocations

Hypha often participates in exciting projects where clients may offer incentives to individual key contributors at various stages, in the form of shares (e.g., founders shares, stock options, RSUs), tokens, bonuses, or other incentive-alignment mechanisms. Members are free to make these direct arrangements with clients as appropriate.

Historically, there are cases where Hypha gets a small allocation, or does not involve in the allocation agreements at all, while at other times the co-operative will directly join onto capitalization tables. This depends highly on the client's intention and Hypha's role in the project. When Hypha receives these asset allocations, they become part of Hypha's assets and is collectively managed by the membership just like other asset types.

## Democratic Governance Participation

A worker co-operative is democratically managed by its membership, which means the most important decisions require one-person-one-vote approvals as defined in our [bylaws](bylaws.md). These decisions are made throughout the year, and most importantly at our *Annual General Meeting*.

Probationary members, in their first year, will participate in many of the discussions without actual voting power. Once one becomes accepted as a full member, they will become a voting member, and participate not only as a worker, but also as a member, who is responsible for the strategic direction of the co-operative and its responsibilities to the membership.
