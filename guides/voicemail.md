# Voicemail

## Accessing Voicemail 

We use a VoIP phone line provider with forwarding and voicemail from [voip.ms](https://www.voip.ms). It helps us:

- Have a phone number without tying it to a physical location
- Receive voicemail by email to [members@hypha.coop](mailto:members@hypha.coop)
- Receive text messages (SMS) to common e-mail

To access voicemail inbox you can either call remotely or through a configured SIP client.

- Remotely
  1. Call the number `4378876936`  
  1. Wait for the intro audio to finish followed by a 1 second pause
  1. When the audio resumes press `*`
  1. Listen and confirm you hear the prompt `Extension 3101, password`
  1. Enter our password followed by #: in our shared password manager Passbolt

- SIP client: 
  Dial `*98`
