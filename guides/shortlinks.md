# Shortlinks

## Managing shortlinks

We use a custom shortlink service at `link.hypha.coop`. It helps us:
- resolve keywords to URLs from any computer,
- make commonly used resources quickly and easily accessible,
- simplify link-sharing in spoken conversations, and
- align on shorthand keywords for resources.

Instructions on creating and managing shortlinks are available in
our [`configuration` repo under `hyphacoop/shortlinks` directory](https://github.com/hyphacoop/configurations/tree/master/hyphacoop/shortlinks).

## Accessing shortlinks

> **Hint:** You can use a URL hash to deep-link into an expanded shortlink.
> Example:&nbsp;http://link.hypha.coop/inventory#LinkedIn

Shortlinks work on their own in the address bar, but for even easier access on your own
workstation, you can **add a "custom search engine" keyword to your
browser**.

This allows you to type something like `h<tab>shortlinks` into the
search bar, and get https://link.hypha.coop/shortlinks

Here's a screencast of how it works on Chrome:

## Setting up a new project

When a project begins, generate a [Summary Report](https://clockify.me/reports/summary) for the project:

1. Select the appropriate `Client` (and/or `Project`) and `Billing` filters
![timesheets-0](images/timesheets-0.png)

1. Configure the table headings to `Group by: Project > User > Description`

1. Click the share button to reveal the `Share report` dialog
![timesheets-1](images/timesheets-1.png)

1. Name the report `project_YYYYMM` where `YYYYMM` indicates the first month the project is active, leave the `Lock dates` unlocked, and select the appropriate `Visibility` for the project

1. You can now find the link to your project under [Shared Reports](https://clockify.me/reports/shared)

## Generating project timesheets

1. To generate timesheets, open the Shared Report for your project (e.g. [meetcoop_202005](https://clockify.me/shared/5ee22fd6486d877565000755)) and export as PDF for the applicable report period (to be sent to client, if applicable)

1. Timesheet PDFs sent to clients or for internal payroll calculation should be archived in our [shared drive](https://link.hypha.coop/drive) under the `Timesheets` directory
