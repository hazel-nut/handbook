# Shortlinks

## Managing shortlinks

We use a custom shortlink service at `link.hypha.coop`. It helps us:
- resolve keywords to URLs from any computer,
- make commonly used resources quickly and easily accessible,
- simplify link-sharing in spoken conversations, and
- align on shorthand keywords for resources.

Instructions on creating and managing shortlinks are available in
our [`configuration` repo under `hyphacoop/shortlinks` directory](https://github.com/hyphacoop/configurations/tree/master/hyphacoop/shortlinks).

## Accessing shortlinks

> **Hint:** You can use a URL hash to deep-link into an expanded shortlink.
> Example:&nbsp;http://link.hypha.coop/inventory#LinkedIn

Shortlinks work on their own in the address bar, but for even easier access on your own
workstation, you can **add a "custom search engine" keyword to your
browser**.

This allows you to type something like `h<tab>shortlinks` into the
search bar, and get https://link.hypha.coop/shortlinks

Here's a screencast of how it works on Chrome:
